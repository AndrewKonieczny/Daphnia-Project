#Daphnia-Project

This is a repository for the code I made over the past year (Fall 2014 - Spring 2015) for professor [Dr. Matthew Beckman](http://www.augsburg.edu/faculty/beckmanm/). I worked with Dr. Beckman at [Augsburg College](http://www.augsburg.edu). We researched how a dopaminergic drug affected the force produced by the invertebrate [_Daphnia magna_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphnia_magna) while swimming. I wrote this code (mostly R code) to analyze data gatherd from videos of the tethered animal swimming, (using ImageJ to analyze the videos).

#Daphnia-Project

This is a repository for the code I made over the past year (Fall 2014 - Spring 2015) for professor Dr. Matthew Beckman. I worked with Dr. Beckman at Augsburg College. We researched how a dopaminergic drug affected the force produced by the invertebrate _Daphnia_magna_ while swimming. I wrote this code (mostly R code) to analyze data gatherd from videos of the tethered animal swimming, (using ImageJ to analyze the videos).
